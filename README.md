# Details about repository:
  This is a repository for performing laboratory work on the subject "Computer systems automated design". The main branch is develop. Branches named "feature/develop/<task number>" are created to perform laboratory work. 
Here will be the game rock paper scissors with communication schema SW(client) <-> UART <-> HW(server)

# Task details:
## General requirements:
  The root folder should have next directories if required:
  1) ***3party - for all third party tools***;
  2) ***lib - for libs***;
  3) ***build - for generated code, binaries…***;
  4) ***ci - for continuous integration scripts***;
  5) ***media - for images and video***;
  6) ***config - for configuration files***;
MVC is the most common architecture design. But the student can use another
approach. It should have strong arguments about props and cons for the used
approach.
Must be used:
  ∙ * *Patterns* *;
  ∙ * *Data driven approach* *;

## Develop area:
  ∙ Hardware (HW) and Desktop software (SW)

## Menu:
Game should have a menu that allows to configure parameters:
Play modes:
  1. **Man vs AI**
  2. **Man vs Man**
  3. **AI vs AI:**
  * _Random move_
  * _Win strategy_

## Actions:
  1) **New**;
  2) **Save**;
  3) **Load**;

# Tasks by student:
1) **Student number:** 2
2) **Game:** rock paper scissors
3) **Config format:** JSON

# Technical details:
In this project i'm going to use C++&C#. As for the HW I'm going to use Arduino NANO v3.
